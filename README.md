*The Worldwide Development of the COVID-19 Pandemic*

OBJECTIVE 1     Visualise the Spread of the Virus in Terms of Mortality
Outcomes:       time series + mapping (geospatial visualisation)

OBJECTIVE 2     Geographic Heterogeneity in the Virus in Terms of Mortality
Outcomes:       static maps + regional heterogeneity (e.g. showing death/infection rate by age, across geographies)

OBJECTIVE 3     Mortality Outcomes in key regions/geographies (the temporal evolution of the virus)
Outcomes:       time series with specific national policy events
