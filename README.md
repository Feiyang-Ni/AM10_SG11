**The Worldwide Development of the COVID-19 Pandemic**

*OBJECTIVE 1*     Visualise the Spread of the Virus in Terms of Mortality
Outcomes:       time series + mapping (geospatial visualisation)

*OBJECTIVE 2*     Geographic Heterogeneity in the Virus in Terms of Mortality
Outcomes:       static maps + regional heterogeneity (e.g. showing death/infection rate by age, across geographies)

*OBJECTIVE 3*     Mortality Outcomes in key regions/geographies (the temporal evolution of the virus)
Outcomes:       time series with specific national policy events

**Visualisation Ideas / Checklist**

1. Time Series Plot
2. Parallel Sets Plot
3. Mapping (static and interactive / dynamic / time series)
