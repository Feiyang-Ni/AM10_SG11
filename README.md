*The Worldwide Development of the COVID-19 Pandemic*

1. The Spread of the Virus (in terms of cases and deaths) - time series + mapping (geospatial visualisation)
2. Geographic Heterogeneity (in terms of cases and deaths) - static maps + regional heterogeneity (e.g. showing death/infection rate by age, across geographies)
3. Outcomes in key regions/geographies (the temporal evolution of the virus) - time series with specific national policy events
